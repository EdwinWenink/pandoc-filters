# Ad-hoc URL manipulation

This lua filter solves an annoying problem I have when trying to use my Zettelkasten notes in combination with Hugo.

My notes link to files in a flat file system and look like this `[description](target.md)`. 
That is, I don't make any assumption about file structure.
I myself use a flat file structure and even if I wouldn't, Vim could figure out where the file is with a recursive search.

Problems:

1. Hugo renders content with pretty URLs by default, i.e. without extension
2. Hugo converts all paths to lowercase by default
3. On top of that, I use relative links. 

This requires three fixes to make default Markdown links work without using default Hugo functions `ref` or `relRef`, which I don't want in my files because I don't want my content to only display nicely with Hugo!

1. Remove extension
2. Convert to lower case
3. Prepend a base URL to resolve the relative link correctly (assuming flat Zettelk√§sten structure)

So this script is very specific to my needs, but may serve as inspiration for someone else. It's easy to adapt.
